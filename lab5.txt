from the lab session 5 i have learnt the execution of the following 
programs:

(1)To write a program to display or print the sequence of numbers from 1 to 10
The shell script code would be:

code: echo "enter a number"
      read n
      for((i=1;i<=10;i++))
      do
       echo "$i"
      done
output of the above code would be:
      enter a number
      10
      1
      2
      3
      4
      5
      6
      7
      8
      9
      10
       
(2)To write a program to check whether the number is prime or not:

code: echo "enter a number"
      read numb
      i=2
      while[ $i lt $numb]
      do
      if[expr $numb % $i eq 0]
      then
      echo "$numb is not a prime number"
      echo "since it is not divisible by $i"
      exit from the loop
      fi
      i=expr $i+1
      done
      echo "$num is a prime number"
