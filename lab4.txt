        read n
	if test $n-gt 0
	then
  		  echo "number is positive"
	else
      		  echo "number is negative"
	fi
	Now use the show command 
	//enter a number
	2
	abcde.sh: 3: test: 2-gt: unexpected operator
	number is negative
	//enter a number
	1
	abcde.sh: 3: test: 1-gt: unexpected operator
	number is negative
3)Write a shell script to print the students grade[above 90-A,80-B,70-C,60-D else FAIL]

	echo " enter your marks"
	read n
	if [ "$n" -ge 90 ]
	then
        	echo " you got A"
	elif [ "$n" -ge 80 ]
	then
                echo " you got B"
        elif [ "$n" -ge 70 ]
        then
                        echo " you got C"
                elif [ "$n" -ge 60]
